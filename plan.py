# Let us assume the raw data is in the form of an array that is 16 by 30
# Let us assume there are 99 mines in total 

# There are two systems where we solve one square
# 1. Guessing
#    * For the lolz, lets implement a monte carlo search tree for this portion
# 2. Calculating

# Calculating module

# Each square has 8 other squares that can effect the squares outcome 

# Each individual square has power in determining the location of the mine
# and the likely hood of there being a mine around it 

# 16 by 30 array

# number on the map is represented as
