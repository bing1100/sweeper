# Inteligence module

# Going to use a decision tree to record patterns and so that
#  the program will run faster as it collects more information

# The decision tree will work in this way:
#  We will have a fixed algorithm to look for patterns.
#  The decision tree will be updated every time a pattern has been
#  solved.
# Each node represents the value of a block chosen through the algorithm

# Higher levels can be implemented (higher levels means we investigate outside of
#  the set block)
